# Box Box
## alexa skill for keeping fridge inventory in numbered boxes

Box Box lets you keep inventory of foods you cooked and put in the fridge.

All you need to do is number your boxes (write a number on each box). 

Let's assume you cooked a delicious bolognaise sauce. When you put it in the frige (in box number 4), just say:

"Alexa, tell Box Box to put Bolognaise sauce in box four"

Box Box will remember what is in each box, and when it was put there. So you can ask:

"Alexa, ask Box Box what is in box four"

and it will tell you the content (bolognaise sauce) and the date it was put in.

You can also get a list of all things in your fridge by saying:

"Alexa, ask Box Box what is in my fridge"

Have fun
